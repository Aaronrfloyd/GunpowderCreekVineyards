			<h1><strong>Gunpowder Creek Vineyards</strong></h1>
			<p>Years in the making, Gunpowder Creek Vineyards, located in the rolling hills of Union, Kentucky is a vineyard wine and food enthusiasts should keep on their radar. I have had my eye on the journey of this vineyard since owner and wine maker Jon Floyd, made the announcement of wanting to venture into the world of wine making. With hard work and determination to master many arts Jon and his father have hand built everything on the property, including the wine production room and soon to be tasting room. They've also prepared the land for the vines themselves and continue to tend to the growth of the grapes, on top of the actual wine making production and process. The attention to detail completely shows in the beauty of the land and in the wine. Having tasted the grapes straight off of the vine, as well as sampling of some of the product, I am so pleased and proud to watch this vineyard continue to master the art of winemaking. Take a closer look into the story behind Gunpowder Creek Vineyards father-son duo that started it all below.</p>

			<h1>About Gunpowder Jon</h1>
			<p>Jon Floyd grew up and graduated high school in Monroe, Ohio. In his younger years he lived in College Hill and was home schooled. "I wouldn’t even know what to say for an occupation, I do a little of everything; I bartend on weekend nights, I have been in the restaurant/bar industry for the past 10 years. I split the rest of my time between metal fabrication and building the vineyard."</p>

			<p>"We are growing Arandell, Aromella, Cayuga, Norton and Stuben grapes. Just do it. If you feel it’s the path for you, buckle down and get it done. Figure out the hoops you have to jump through and be on your way. It will take sacrifice, mostly of time, but you won’t be wasting it. Without makers and doers within our younger generation, it would be a pretty boring future."
